## Approach
1. I went through the links to make sure atleast some of them are working.
2. Then I used BeautifulSoup to check how many of them return a title string. This helped me get a rough count of how many values should I be expecting in the final data, which was around 89.
3. Then I switched to selenium which is better and more consistent when it comes to data scraping.
4. I reviewed some amazon product pages from different countries to know what tag I am looking for while scraping the data. 
5. I also revied different products because some tages differ based on the type of product.
6. After these basic steps I was pretty much done and just had to run the scrapper by passing all the urls one by one.
7. My Final run of the code retrieved 93 products.
8. The code retrieves most of the data and is better than my initial approach using BeautifulSoup.
